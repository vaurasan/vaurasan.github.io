		<h3>This is my short introduction</h3><br>
        I am thrilled to share my journey as a Haaga-Helia student. I am taking a dive into the world of Business Information Technology.
        <br><br>
        The main focus of my studies lie in ICT-Infrastructure and Cloud Services. But on top of that, I am going to be taking courses from other IT orientations as well.
        My goal is to graduate somewhere during the year 2026.
        <br><br>
        Feel free to browse my GitHub page, where you will find some of my stydy materials in finnish. Also my LinkedIn page contains my whole work and study related history.

        This is the first iteration of the website and is likely to be updated. By the way, this website is hosted by my own cloud server running on Debian Linux.
